Fedora Scripts
This project's purpose is to automate several tasks in Fedora workstation.
At the moment, these are just personal scripts I use that you can use and personalize for your own
reference, however the general direction of this project will change for more general use.

If you are interested in me creating more generalized task scripts,
send me a message and I will attempt to do so.
